## What is the purpose of the project and why is it necessary ? 
<p><em>If investigators already know the forensic tools and how to extract the required data
from files, why would they need a specialized tool to do it for them?</em></p>

We are human beings, and we tend to make mistakes by missing vital information or
issuing incorrect commands. The risk of losing crucial data is ever-present. To
address this challenge, we've developed a tool designed to automate and correct
these issues systematically. An additional advantage of automation is evident when
investigators need to analyze multiple memory files. Manually typing each command
can be time-consuming, potentially taking hours.
The goal is to enhance efficiency through automation, ensuring a thorough and
error-free analysis of data in the most comprehensive manner possible.

This project addresses the need for an efficient solution in digital forensic analysis.
By automating hard disk drive (HDD) and memory investigations, the program
ensures the accurate identification, extraction, and display of critical data elements,
such as network traffic and human-readable information.
It seamlessly integrates with Volatility software for thorough memory analysis and
generates detailed reports. This automated approach is essential, as manual
processes by investigators may result in data loss.
Additionally, the program includes a dedicated function for installing essential
forensic tools, ensuring a streamlined and accurate operation.

## Script structure and operating instructions 
Before running the script, ensure you have either a memory file, a hard disk drive, or
a directory containing the files you want to analyze, which will be provided to the tool
for analysis.

Before running the script,
please ensure that a directory named **'DataAnalysis'** does not exist in your current location.

If it does, kindly remove it to ensure smooth execution of the script.

(To remove it, you can either right-click on the **'DataAnalysis'** directory and choose **'Remove'**).

Or use the following command in the terminal: **rm -rf DataAnalysis.**
